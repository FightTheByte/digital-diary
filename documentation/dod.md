# Definition Of Done

Provide a reflective journal that allows the user to create, read and delete entries. Allow the user to tag the entries with keywords, topics or themes. Allow the user to filter based on date, title or tag. The journal will look aesthetically appropriate, meeting the common convention of competitors and will be easy to use.
